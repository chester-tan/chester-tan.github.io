# Why I Love Free and Open Source Software \(FOSS\)

# Why I Love FOSS

I love Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for many reasons:

* Privacy
  For one, end-to-end encryption is arguably redundant if the protocol and clients are not open source. Client, following their protocol, handle your keys, and if a client is not open source, there is no way to know how it is using your keys to protect your privacy, if at all.

* Transparency
  This is not limited to FOSS; for example, there can be transparency in how many consumer products are produced. For food, the entire supply chain can be documented, from how each ingredient was sourced, the labor conditions, etc.

* Collaboration
  I believe in that FOSS, openness and transparency brings out the best in human collaboration and synergy.

* Reproducibility
