# Why I Love FOSS

I love Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for many reasons:

* Privacy
  For one, end-to-end encryption is arguably redundant if the protocol and clients are not open source. Client, following their protocol, handle your keys, and if a client is not open source, there is no way to know how it is using your keys to protect your privacy, if at all.

* Transparency
  This is not limited to FOSS; for exmaple, there can be transparency in how many consumer products are produced. For food, the entire supply chain can be documented, from how each ingredient was sourced, the labor conditions, etc.

* Collaboration
  I believe in that FOSS, openness and transparency brings out the best in human collaboration and synergy.

# FOSS I Use

These are some FOSS I use and am exploring:

* Instant Messaging:
  * E2EE Protocols:
    * Serverless:
      * [Briar](https://briarproject.org/)
      * [Tox](https://tox.chat/)
    * Decentralized:
      * [XMPP/Jabber](https://xmpp.org)
        Older, but more distributed protocol. I use the [Conversations](https://conversations.im) client which has good support for multiple accounts, and I also use conversation's hosting services to host my own XMPP server.
      * [Matrix](https://matrix.org)
        Newer and feature rich, but more centralized in the sense that most users use the main server [matrix.org](https://matrix.org). [Element](https://element.io) is a client and also a hosting service, but their hosted [pricing](https://element.io/pricing) is more expensive then XMPP's conversations.
    * Centralized:
      * [Signal](https://signal.org)
      * [MTProto \(Telegram\)](https://telegram.org)
* Email:
  * [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com)
    I love what [Proton Technologies AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_Technologies) does - providing private, secure and convenient email and VPN \(and more\) services to the masses, providing free email and VPN services to those that can't afford to pay for it. I subscribe to their paid plans to support their services, and they host my custom domain email alias. They have FOSS mobile and web clients. [mail@chester-tan.com](mailto:mail@chester-tan.com)
  * [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com)
    Tutanota is another great private, secure, and convenient email provider, and they have FOSS mobile, desktop, and web clients. 
  * [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/)
    An android email client that supports IMAP and POP, and makes fetching Gmail and Outlook very easy! It also works well with [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) to encrypt, sign, and verify emails.
* Files Synchronization and Backup:
  * [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) is an amazing P2P file synchronization application for mobile and desktop.
* Real-Time Collaboration:
  * [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr)
  E2EE and open source collaboration suite.
  * [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com)
  Collaborative LaTeX editor
  * [HackMD](https://hackmd.io)
  Collaborative markdown editor with support for creating presentation slides from markdown.
* Text Editors:
  * Cross-Platform:
    * Joplin
    * Standard Notes
  * Desktop:
    * Doom Emacs
    * ViM and NeoViM
    * Helix
* Web Browsers:
  * Firefox with extensions:
    * Bitwarden
    * DuckDuckGp
    * Multi-Account Containers
    * Vimium C
  * Chromium for use with Selenium for web scraping
* Operating Systems:
  * Mobile:
    * [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org)
  * Desktop:
    * [NixOS](https://nixos.org)
