I love Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for many reasons, and are these are some of the ones I use:

* Email Clients:
  * [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com)
    I love what [Proton Technologies AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_Technologies) does - providing private, secure and convenient email and VPN \(and more\) services to the masses, providing free email and VPN services to those that can't afford to pay for it. I subscribe to their paid plans to support their services, and they host my custom domain email alias. They have FOSS mobile and web clients. [mail@chester-tan.com](mailto:mail@chester-tan.com)
  * [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com)
    Tutanota is another great private and secure email provider, and they have FOSS mobile, desktop, and web clients. 
  * [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/)
    An android email client that supports IMAP and POP, and makes fetching Gmail and Outlook very easy! It also works well with [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) to verify emails.
