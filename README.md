This repo hosts the source code for my personal website [chester-tan.com](https://chester-tan.com).

The site is built from markdown files using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com), and deployed using (GitHub Pages)(https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).
