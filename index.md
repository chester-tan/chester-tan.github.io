# Hello!

Hi! I'm Chester. Welcome to my personal website \:\)

I'm a PhD Student with [Ingo Scholtes](https://www.ingoscholtes.net/) at the chair of [Machine Learning for Complex Networks](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ml4nets/team/), [Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (CAIDAS)](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/caidas/), [Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/), currently focusing on temporal/dynamic graphs/networks and connecting graph machine learning / geometric deep learning with discrete spacetime approaches to quantum gravity. Some other research interests include (long-range) sequence models, machine learning methods for particle physics, and collective intelligence, and I love trying to connect them all!

I was previously at Imperial College London where I did an MSci in \"Physics with Theoretical Physics\", and studied complexity science and network science with some wonderful people at the [Centre for Complexity Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science) including [Max Falkenberg](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2986-2494) and [Tim Evans](http://netplexity.org/) and [Kim Christensen](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.christensen).

I'm interested in many things including network science, complexity science, physics, machine learning, free and open source software, and much more!

Thank you for visiting my website \:\) The following list lists all my other online presences. If you'd like to chat about anything at all please feel free to contact me through your most preferred platform!
