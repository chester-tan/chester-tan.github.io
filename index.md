# Hello!

Hi! I'm Chester. Welcome to my personal website \:\)

I'm a researcher studying complex systems, and I'm interested in many things including complexity science, network science, physics, free and open source software, and much more! 

I'm currently a research assistant at the National University of Singapore working with [Cynthia Siew](https://csqsiew.netlify.app/) on studying Singapore-English (Singlish) through the lens of network science and psycholinguistics, inspired primarily by the [Small World of Words project](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/home).

I was previously at Imperial College London where I did an MSci in \"Physics with Theoretical Physics\", and studied complex systems with some wonderful people at the [Centre for Complexity Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science) including [Max Falkenberg](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2986-2494) and [Tim Evans](http://netplexity.org/) and [Kim Christensen](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.christensen).

Thank you for visiting my website \:\) The following list lists all my other online presences. If you'd like to chat about anything at all please feel free to contact me through your most preferred platform!
