# Hello!

Hi! I'm Chester. Welcome to my personal website \:\)

I'm a PhD Student at the chair of [Machine Learning for Complex Networks](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ml4nets/team/), [Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (CAIDAS)](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/caidas/), [Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/), currently focusing on causality in (temporal / dynamic) graph embeddings / graph representation learning, while exploring "Machine Learning for Complex Networks" in all its possible permutations and meanings, including its relationships to neural cellular automata, self-organizing maps, meta-learning, graph data structures and databases, differential privacy, and more. 

I was previously at Imperial College London where I did an MSci in \"Physics with Theoretical Physics\", and studied complex systems and networks with some wonderful people at the [Centre for Complexity Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science) including [Max Falkenberg](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2986-2494) and [Tim Evans](http://netplexity.org/) and [Kim Christensen](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.christensen).

I'm interested in many things including complexity science, network science, physics, free and open source software, and much more! 

Thank you for visiting my website \:\) The following list lists all my other online presences. If you'd like to chat about anything at all please feel free to contact me through your most preferred platform!
