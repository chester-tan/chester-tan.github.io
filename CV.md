## \#\# How Do Hidden Networks Affect Network Evolution

_May 2020 – August 2021_

With Max Falkenberg. Studying how hidden networks affect the temporal evolution of observed networks, and developing a framework to extract hidden networks from observed data, with many potential transdisciplinary applications, including, but not limited to, the analysis of social networks. Involves analytical and numerical studies \(and development\) of many popular network growth models and novel growth models. Research conducted as an academic visitor at the [Centre for Complexity Science, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science).

## \#\# [MSci Project](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduate-and-masters-degree-courses-list/msci-projects/): Spacetime Random Geometric Graphs

_June 2019 – May 2020_

Supervised by Tim S. Evans. Developed a novel graph model for the popular Gilbert disk random geometric graph in spacetime, using ideas from directed acyclic graphs, directed percolation, and causal set theory. Studied directed percolation and path lengths in the model, generating Monte Carlo simulations in up to 5\+1D on the Imperial College London High Performance Computing cluster. Investigated both numerical and analytical solutions to its particular scale-dependent critical density. Developed a novel search algorithm for DAGs in undirected graphs to comparatively study DAGs in other spaces, including spaces of varying Minkowski distance order. [MSci project](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduate-and-masters-degree-courses-list/msci-projects/) involved membership and enthusiastic participation at the [Centre for Complexity Science, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science).

_July 2019 – August 2019_

Joint work with Girish S Vishwa supervised by Kim Christensen & Max Falkenberg. Studied bond and surface percolation in a cellular automata models of atrial fibrillation. Generated Monte Carlo percolation simulations and analysed their scaling, facilitating classification into known universality classes, thereby providing justification for a range of known analyses techniques in literature.
