Theoretical physics MSci graduate from Imperial College London with key research interests in complex systems and network science.

## \#\# Education

### \#\#\# [Master in Science (MSci) Physics with Theoretical Physics from Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/physics-department/theoretical-physics-msci/)

*October 2016 – June 2020*

A 4-year integrated undergraduate\+master’s physics programme with a focus on theoretical physics.

## \#\# Research Experience

### \#\#\# [Summer Research Project](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop/): Percolation in Atrial Fibrillation Models

*July 2019 – August 2019*

Supervised by Kim Christensen & Max Falkenberg. Studied bond and surface percolation in a cellular automata models of atrial fibrillation. Generated Monte Carlo percolation simulations and analysed their scaling, facilitating classification into known universality classes, thereby providing justification for a range of known analyses techniques in literature. An [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme \(UROP\)](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop/) with the [Centre for Complexity Science, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science). 

### \#\#\# [MSci Project](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduate-and-masters-degree-courses-list/msci-projects/): Spacetime Random Geometric Graphs

*June 2019 – May 2020*

Supervised by Tim S. Evans. Developed a novel graph model for the popular Gilbert disk random geometric graph in spacetime, using ideas from directed acyclic graphs, directed percolation, and causal set theory. Studied directed percolation and path lengths in the model, generating Monte Carlo simulations in up to 5\+1D on the Imperial College London High Performance Computing cluster. Investigated both numerical and analytical solutions to its particular scale-dependent critical density. Developed a novel search algorithm for DAGs in undirected graphs to comparatively study DAGs in other spaces, including spaces of varying Minkowski distance order. [MSci project](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduate-and-masters-degree-courses-list/msci-projects/) involved membership and enthusiastic participation at the [Centre for Complexity Science, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science).

### \#\#\# How Do Hidden Networks Affect Network Evolution

*May 2020 – Present*

With Max Falkenberg. Studying how hidden networks affect the temporal evolution of observed networks, and developing a framework to extract hidden networks from observed data, with many potential transdisciplinary applications, including, but not limited to, the analysis of social networks. Involves analytical and numerical studies \(and development\) of many popular network growth models and novel growth models. Research conducted as an academic visitor at the [Centre for Complexity Science, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science).

### \#\#\# [The Small World of Singlish Words](https://singlishwords.nus.edu.sg)

*May 2020 – Present*

With Cynthia S. Q. Siew and Jazton Chern. A Singapore-English \(Singlish\) spin on the [Small World of Words project](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/home) – to collect and study free assiociation data for Singlish.

## \#\# Employment History

### \#\#\# Republic of Singapore Air Force
**Tactical Control Officer, Lieutenant, Ground Based Air Defence**

*February 2014 – December 2015*

11 months in Officer Cadet School, commissioned as a Ground Based Air Defence Air Warfare Officer, then worked another 11 months as a Tactical Control Officer on active duty operating the Raytheon I-Hawk surface-to-air missile system. Planned and led exercises assuming roles of 1st or 2nd-in-command, and was in charge of chemical defence training for my flight (platoon). Designed an aircraft engagement Microsoft Excel VBA workbook for more efficient and accurate evaluation of exercises (incorporating Vincenty’s solutions on a WGS 84 ellipsoid, missile proportional navigation, and radar atmospheric refraction).
